/**
 * The kinds of task the bot stores, one constant for each.
 *
 * <p>Two facts about each kind used to be written down twice. The letter that
 * names it in the save file was returned by the subclass and spelled out again
 * as a {@code case} label in {@link Storage}; and how many fields its lines
 * carry appeared only in {@code Storage}, as the bare numbers 3, 4 and 5.
 * Nothing tied the copies together, so a fourth kind of task would have been
 * saved happily and then refused on the next run as an unknown type -- losing
 * the task in silence, which is the one thing the save file exists to
 * prevent.</p>
 *
 * <p>Holding both facts here makes a kind of task a type rather than a loose
 * letter, which lets {@code Storage} {@code switch} over these constants. A
 * {@code switch} expression over an enum must cover every one of them, so adding
 * a kind of task now stops the compiler until the reading side has been taught
 * about it. That is the same arrangement {@link piplupbot.command.CommandWord
 * CommandWord} already uses for the words a user types.</p>

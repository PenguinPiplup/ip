/**
 * Represents the orders the task list can be put into, one constant for each
 * word the user may type after {@code sort}.
 *
 * <p>Each constant carries the word to match and the order it stands for, in the
 * way {@link TaskType} carries a letter and a field count: keeping the two
 * together is what lets {@link #fromKeyword} build its hint from
 * {@link #values()}, so a fifth key would appear in the hint by itself rather
 * than having to be spelled out a second time somewhere else.</p>
 *
 * <p>Every comparator here reads a task by asking it -- for its date, its
 * description, its type or its done status -- rather than by testing which kind
 * of task it is. That is the same polymorphism that lets one list hold all three
 * kinds and print them without a {@code switch}, and it is why a fourth kind of
 * task would sort correctly without a line changing here.</p>

/**
 * Which way round a sort runs: {@code asc} for smallest first, {@code desc} for
 * largest first.
 *
 * <p>A direction is a word the user types, so it needs the same three things
 * {@link piplupbot.command.CommandWord CommandWord} needs -- the spelling to
 * match, a way to refuse anything else, and a hint naming what would have
 * worked. That is why it is an enum rather than the {@code boolean} a caller
 * could pass just as easily: {@link piplupbot.command.MarkCommand MarkCommand}
 * carries a boolean because nobody types it, while this is read off the line.</p>
 *
 * <p>What each direction <em>means</em> is left to {@link SortKey}, which owns
 * the order being turned round. This class knows only how to turn one round.</p>

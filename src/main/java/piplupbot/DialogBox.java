/**
 * Represents one message in the window's conversation: the words in a speech
 * bubble, beside a round picture of whoever said them.
 *
 * <p>The user's messages sit on the right with the picture last, as in most chat
 * apps, and the bot's sit on the left with the picture first. That is the only
 * difference in how they are built, so one class serves both. Its constructor
 * is private, and the three factory methods -- {@link #getUserDialog},
 * {@link #getBotDialog} and {@link #getErrorDialog} -- say which kind of message
 * is wanted, which reads better at the call than a {@code true} or
 * {@code false} would.</p>
 *
 * <p>What a message is made of is described in the layout file
 * {@code view/DialogBox.fxml}, laid out as one of the user's; for the bot's,
 * this class swaps the two parts round. How it looks -- the bubble's color, its
 * rounded corners, the gaps around it -- is decided by the window's stylesheet,
 * {@code main.css}, which finds each part by its style class: {@code dialog-box}
 * for the whole message and {@code bubble} for the words, both given in the
 * layout file, plus {@code user}, {@code bot} or {@code error}, given here, for
 * whose message it is.</p>
 *
 * <p>It is an {@link HBox} -- a row of nodes, laid out left to right -- so the
 * window can add it to the conversation like any other node.</p>

/**
 * Turns a line the user typed into the {@link Command} it asks for.
 *
 * <p>Every command that carries more than its own keyword needs its line pulled
 * apart before anything can be done with it: a deadline hides a description and
 * a date on either side of {@code /by}, an event hides three parts, and
 * {@code mark} hides a number. That work used to sit in {@link PiplupBot}
 * alongside the decisions about what to do with the result, which meant the
 * class that decides <em>what</em> a command means also had to know the exact
 * spelling of every separator.</p>
 *
 * <p>Splitting the two apart leaves this class with one job: read the line, or
 * explain why it cannot be read. Nothing here stores a task, prints anything, or
 * knows that a task list exists -- it hands back a command and lets the caller
 * decide when to run it. That is also what makes it easy to test:
 * {@link #parse} is a line of text in, a command or a {@link PiplupBotException}
 * out.</p>
 *
 * <p>Unlike {@link Ui} and {@link TaskList}, this is a class of static methods
 * rather than an object to create, because it has nothing to remember between
 * calls. Reading one line tells it nothing it would want to know while reading
 * the next, so there is no state for an object to hold and no reason to make one.</p>
 *
 * <p>Recognising the word itself is still {@link CommandWord#fromInput}'s
 * question, not this class's: the enum holds the keywords, so matching them
 * belongs with them. This class asks that question and then does what the enum
 * cannot -- build the command object, filled in with whatever the rest of the
 * line said.</p>

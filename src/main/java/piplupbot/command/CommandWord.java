/**
 * The words PiplupBot recognises at the start of a line, one for each command
 * it understands.
 *
 * <p>The enum is named for the word rather than for the command because the
 * word is all it decides: which one was typed, whether anything may follow it,
 * and how to spell it back to the user in a hint. What the command then
 * <em>does</em> is settled elsewhere, by whoever is handed the answer.</p>
 *
 * <p>Holding the keywords here rather than as loose {@code String} constants
 * means the bot has one list of commands instead of several: the word to match,
 * whether the command expects anything after it, and the hint shown for an
 * unknown command all come from these constants. Adding a command is therefore
 * one edit here plus one branch in the main loop.</p>
 *
 * <p>The constants are declared in the order the hint lists them, because the
 * hint is built from {@link #values()}.</p>

/**
 * Puts the stored tasks into a given order and shows the result.
 *
 * <p>Unlike {@link ListCommand} and {@link FindCommand}, which only read the
 * list, this command rearranges it: the tasks themselves are reordered and
 * written to disk. That is what makes the numbers beside the rows usable --
 * {@code mark 2} straight after a sort marks the second row the user was just
 * shown -- and it is also what costs them the order the tasks were added in,
 * which is kept nowhere and so cannot be restored.</p>
 *
 * <p>Which order the tasks go into is {@link SortKey}'s question and
 * {@link SortDirection}'s; carrying them out is {@link TaskList#sort}'s. All
 * this command decides is what to call the list it shows, and that the change
 * should be saved.</p>

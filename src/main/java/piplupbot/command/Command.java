/**
 * Represents one thing the user asked the bot to do, ready to be carried out.
 *
 * <p>A command is created by {@link Parser#parse} once the line has been read
 * and found to make sense, and carried out later by {@link #execute}. Splitting
 * those two moments apart is the point of this class: reading a line and acting
 * on it used to happen in one step, in a {@code switch} that had to name every
 * command in the same place. Now each command is an object that carries whatever
 * it needs -- the task to add, the number to delete -- and knows how to do its
 * own work.</p>
 *
 * <p>The gain is that adding a command becomes an addition rather than an edit.
 * A new command is a new subclass plus one line in {@link Parser#parse};
 * {@link PiplupBot#run} does not change at all, because it only ever asks a
 * command to execute itself and does not care which kind it got. That is
 * polymorphism doing the dispatching the {@code switch} used to do by hand.</p>
 *
 * <p>This is an abstract class rather than an interface because it carries
 * shared behavior as well as a shape: {@link #isExit()} answers {@code false}
 * for every command but one, {@link #save} is the same three lines in every
 * command that changes the list, and {@link #describeTaskCount} is the same
 * closing sentence for every add and delete. Subclasses inherit all three
 * instead of repeating them.</p>

     * <p>Every command is handed the same three things, whether or not it uses
     * them, so that {@link PiplupBot#run} can call this method without knowing
     * which command it holds. {@link ListCommand}, for instance, never touches
     * the storage. The alternative -- a different set of parameters per command
     * -- would put the {@code switch} back, since the caller would have to know
     * which command it had in order to know what to pass it.</p>

     * @throws PiplupBotException If the command cannot be carried out, e.g. it
     *                            names a task number that does not exist.

/**
 * A simple chatbot that keeps a list of tasks, in the console or in a window.
 * It greets the user, stores three kinds of task -- {@code todo},
 * {@code deadline} and {@code event} -- lists the stored tasks on the
 * {@code list} command, marks a task as done on the {@code mark <number>}
 * command, reverses that on the {@code unmark <number>} command,
 * removes a task on the {@code delete <number>} command,
 * shows the tasks whose description contains some text on the
 * {@code find <keyword>} command,
 * and exits when the user types {@code bye}.
 *
 * <p>Every change to the list is written straight to the hard disk by
 * {@link Storage}, and read back when the program starts, so the tasks survive
 * the program being closed.</p>
 *
 * <p>This class is the conversation and nothing else. It hands each line to
 * {@link Parser}, asks the {@link Command} that comes back to carry itself out,
 * and reports when one of them says the conversation is over. What a command
 * <em>does</em> is that command's own business, holding the tasks is
 * {@link TaskList}'s, and saying things out loud is {@link Ui}'s.</p>
 *
 * <p>The bot does not keep a {@link Ui} of its own. It is handed one along with
 * each line, just as a {@link Command} is, and that is what lets one bot serve
 * two faces: {@link #run} drives it from the console with a {@link TextUi}, and
 * the window, which is itself a {@link GuiUi}, drives it by handing over
 * itself. {@link Launcher} decides which of the two the user gets. They differ
 * only in how a line reaches the bot and how the answer is shown -- never in
 * what the answer is, because both go through {@link #respondTo}.</p>
 *
 * <p>So nothing here knows how a command is spelled, what any of them do, how a
 * list is indexed, or how a reply is laid out on screen. The measure of that is
 * that this file no longer names a single command: teaching the bot a new one
 * leaves it untouched.</p>

/**
 * Represents the bot's face in a window: the conversation so far, as a column
 * of speech bubbles, above a box to type in and a button to send what is typed.
 *
 * <p>It plays two parts at once. As a JavaFX {@link Application}, it builds the
 * window and hands each line typed in the box to {@link PiplupBot#respondTo} --
 * the same method the console uses. As a {@link Ui}, it is where the bot's
 * replies go: {@link #show} adds each one to the conversation as a
 * {@link DialogBox}, just as {@link TextUi#show} prints it in the console. So
 * every command behaves the same in both faces, and a new command appears here
 * without any change to this class.</p>
 *
 * <p>This program never creates a {@code GuiUi} itself. {@link Launcher}
 * gives JavaFX the class, and JavaFX starts up, creates the object with the
 * no-argument constructor, and calls {@link #start}. Since nothing can be passed
 * to that constructor, the window makes its own bot, keeping its tasks in the
 * same file as the console -- which is what lets the two faces share one list.
 * It is also why the pictures can be made along with the object: by the time
 * JavaFX makes it, JavaFX is already running.</p>
 *
 * <p>What the window is made of, and where each part sits, is not written here
 * but in the layout file {@code view/MainWindow.fxml}, and how the parts look is
 * in the stylesheet {@code css/main.css}. This class is the layout file's
 * <em>controller</em>: loading the file puts each part it names into the field
 * of the same name marked {@code @FXML}, and makes the input box and the Send
 * button call {@link #handleInput}. What is left here is behavior -- what
 * happens when a line is sent, and how a reply is added.</p>

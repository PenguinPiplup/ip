/**
 * Tests {@link DateTimes}, which is the one place that knows how a date is
 * written in each of the three places the program writes one.
 *
 * <p>This class is tested rather than the rest of the bot because its three
 * public methods are pure functions: a value goes in, and a value -- or a
 * {@link PiplupBotException} -- comes out. Nothing is printed, read from disk
 * or remembered between calls, so a test needs no task list, no save file and
 * no stand-in for the user, which is what makes the failures reported here easy
 * to place.</p>
 *
 * <p>The three methods are tested together because they are three halves of one
 * promise, and it is the relationships between them that matter most: what
 * {@link DateTimes#toFileString} writes, {@link DateTimes#parse} must read back
 * as the same moment, while {@link DateTimes#format} is deliberately allowed to
 * differ from both because it is written for a person rather than for the
 * program.</p>
 *
 * <p>Cases are grouped by what they check rather than by layout. The refusals
 * matter as much as the successes: a lenient formatter would turn
 * {@code 31/2/2019} into 28 February and store a date the user never typed.</p>

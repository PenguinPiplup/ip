 * off-by-one here does not crash: it quietly marks or deletes the task next to
 * the one the user meant, which is the kind of bug a person notices only after
 * losing something. The cases below therefore lean on the boundaries -- the
 * first task, the last task, and the numbers just outside both ends -- because
 * that is exactly where a {@code -1} in the wrong place still looks right for
 * every number in the middle.</p>
 *
 * <p>The other group of cases covers the copies this class makes of the list it
 * is given and the list it hands out. Those copies are invisible in normal use
 * and cost nothing to remove, so without a test that notices, they are easy to
 * "tidy away" -- taking with them the guarantee that the only ways to change
 * the list are {@link TaskList#add} and {@link TaskList#remove}.</p>

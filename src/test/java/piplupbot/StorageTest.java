/**

 *
 * <p>This is the class whose mistakes cost the most. Everything else in the bot
 * fails within one run and can be undone by typing the command again, but a
 * fault here loses tasks the user cannot get back -- and does so quietly, since
 * the file is only read again the next time the bot starts.</p>
 *
 * <p>Two groups of cases follow from that. The first is the round trip: whatever
 * {@link Storage#save} writes, {@link Storage#load} must read back as the same
 * tasks, including descriptions containing the very characters the file format
 * uses. The second is what happens when the file is not what the bot wrote --
 * hand-edited, truncated, or left by an older version. None of those may stop
 * the bot starting, and none may be overwritten without a copy being kept
 * first. A third, smaller group checks that a save which fails leaves the
 * previous file as it was.</p>
 *
 * <p>Every case works inside a folder JUnit creates and deletes for it, so no
 * test can read or damage the real save file.</p>
